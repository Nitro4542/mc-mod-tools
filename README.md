# About this project

This is an installer for my Minecraft mod format.
I've created this project for people who don't know how to install mods and for those, who don't wan't to use some third-party launcher and wan't something safe, ad and crap-free tool.

## How does it work?

## How do I create mod packs for this?

I'm going to create a tool for that. For now you'll have to do it manually.

### File format/structure explained

As this is the Alpha, you can currently only create an info.txt and read it. Later on, you can paste mods.
