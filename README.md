# About this project

This is an installer for my Minecraft mod format.
I created this project for people who don't know how to install mods and for those who don't want to use a third party launcher and want a safe, ad- and crap-free tool.

## How does it work?

## How do I create mod packs for it?

I'm going to make a tool for that. For now, you'll have to do it manually.

## File format/structure explained

As this is an alpha project, you can only create and read an info.txt at the moment. Later you can add mods.
